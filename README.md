## Usage
Open a vmf with straight displacements, together with displacements on top.
The side displacements need to have the Side Texture, and the top displacements need to have Top Texture.
It will not change displacements that are hidden.

The best way to work with this, would be to make the brushes first with a different texture ( nodraw for example ) and to change the textures to the Side Texture and Top Texture when making the displacements.
